# Conway's Game of Life
This is a rewrite of the popular YouTube guide by @[carnesbeau](https://twitter.com/carnesbeau) found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM0_Er3SvFQ&t).

This was rewritten from using the old Class based react model to using functional components and hooks. This was also ported from vanilla ES6 JavaScript to TypeScript.

In this project you will find the following:

 - A completely re-written project using modern React practices with TypeScript
 - React-Bootstrap to style the page
 - Using custom hooks to allow the setInterval, the native JavaScript function to be used with state and update correctly. Find more on about this in a very good article I found [here](https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/)
 - Utilizing built in hooks like useState and useEffect
